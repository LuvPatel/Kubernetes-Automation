# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Terraform, Kubernetes and CI/CD Automation


This project illustrates the understanding of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform to build a Kubernetes cluster from the ground up. It guides through the GCP Cloud Shell, where we can create and manage the GKE cluster. The project also demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys a new image to the GKE cluster whenever code changes are made. All tasks are performed within the Cloud Shell, with the code sourced directly from the Github Repository. This project offers a thorough introduction to GKE, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Highlights
* **Deep Dive into Kubernetes:** The project offers an in-depth exploration of Kubernetes, focusing on the creation of pods, persistent volumes, and services through Kubernetes deployment files
* **Provisioning Resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Terraform:** This project demonstrates the setup and management of GCP resources using Terraform, a robust Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
* **Artifact Registry:** The project utilises the Artifact Registry, used for storing container images and other artifacts.
* **Utilizing Github for Version Control:** The project leverages Github for code storage and version control. Automatic build and deployment processes are triggered with each code push.
